5.00:
----
(read downwards to latest changes)

    since just the very old hardcoded form)

 *  Added confirm dialog on select change page events. Avoids saving into wrong page by accident.
    - adds new constant STATICPAGE_CONFIRM_SELECTDIALOG
 *  Extend required Serendipity version to 1.7 and Smarty 3.1, since the old_backend_staticpage.tpl
    would need too much old Smarty2 and CSS fixes
 *  Removed old hardcoded markup - mark as fully smartified (except inspectConfig generation,
    which is some sort of template too and some minor markups that get hooked)
 *  Changed method name getSystersID() to getSisterID()

 *  Hide/Show the top tab bar menu per JS hideaway, since not used very often
 *  Added for 2.0:
    - navigate with larger amount of entrylist pages per newly added simplePagination.js,
      fits nice beyond 8 to some deci- pages
 *  Changed for 2.0: default config value for show entrylist is now true
 *  Fix and correct entrypaging, breadcrumb and childpage navigations,
    - touches frontend templates (in this plugin dir) for HTML5, inline styles, Navigations, etc.
    - Needs you to update template copies in your template/theme!
 *  Added more backend title attribute information for pageorder and entrylisting titles
 *  Fixed 2.0 Markup in category hook, the example markup in related category Readme, set some more

    TL;DR - MAJOR CHANGES - PLEASE NOTE:
    Some of these commits will change behaviour or appearance for older staticpage entries.
    Please double check all your pages to show up correct, or at least check the major ones in difference.

    Also check for template staticpage files in need for an update. This may effect all kind of
    yourTheme/plugin_staticpage_***.tpl files and probably all backend-form-files in yourTheme/backend_templates/*.
    Theme templates in [2k11, Next, Bulletproof] delivered by core have already been changed when Staticpages DEV moves into Spartacus.

    Temporary disable (by directory name change) previous used theme based staticpage-backend-forms
    in /templates/yourTheme/backend_templates/*. Remove, if these were not specifically theme based, or contact your themes author.

    Check the Plugin configurations (event and sidebar)!

    Apart from UI changes, other small bugfixes, code review, refactoring and code cleanup, this mainly is:

    - A smart rework for 2.0+
    - Smartified the Backend
    - New backend-form-templates. [Check your theme! See note above.]
    - Precise staticpage database SELECT queries for the frontend, the sidebar and the backend
    - Backend listentries enhancements
    - Fixed navigation issues. Touches staticpage frontend related template files for markup navigation changes,
      regarding entry navigation, breadcrumb navigation and child navigation.
      [Check your theme to not work with old and unchanged copies!]
    - Associated strict 1:1 relation for staticpage related categories

3.72:
-----------------------------
Fix for not being able to edit a staticpage through the frontend's

3.70, 3.71:
-----------------------------

Major new functionalities:

    1. Allow to create custom smarty templates used for editing a
       staticpage.
       
       When editing a staticpage in the backend, you now have a dropdown
       where you can choose a template. The default file is placed
       in the plugin's subdirectory "backend_templates". You can
       add files there on your own, which are then shown in the
       dropdown as well.
       
       You can override the content of those files within your
       template directory, by placing a file named exactly the same way,
       in the "backend_templates" sub-directory of your template. 
       Thus, you can put an empty file inside your plugin
       directory to initialize the ability to use a template-preference.
       
       The default template file has several smarty functions to query
       the current value and input fields. You can place all input
       fields the way you like, using Smarty/HTML layouts.
       
       You can also still switch to the "old way" through the dropdown.
       

    2. Introduce "custom properties" for staticpages.
    
        You need to add those custom properties to your custom smarty
        template, by accessing an input field "serendipity[plugin][custom][xxx]".
        The default backend template has a commented section for an
        example on how to use this.
        
        In your final smarty templates (either the staticpage_*.tpl files, or your
        usual smarty template files) you can access those custom properties through
        
        {$staticpage_custom.XXX}
        
        to place them anywhere you want.

To properly see the new layout, you might need to flush your browser's
CSS cache, as changes have been made to the plugin's CSS file.


3.61:

walkrecursive() function is VERY expensive.
