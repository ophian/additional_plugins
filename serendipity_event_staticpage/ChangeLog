-----
 * Improve class properties for PHP 8.2/9.0

6.53:
-----
 * Better check a Smarty internal variable in the backend_staticpage.tpl file for PHP 8.2/9.0

6.52:
-----
 * Add general GarbageCollect cleanup DELETE action for the "custom" database table,
   when deleting a staticpage.

6.51:
-----
 * Overwrite ("existing" COOKIE) backend form template name opening an existing staticpage
   for edit via the staticpage entries list, when the "custom" template form was used to
   create its values and some custom options (other than the auto "nl2br" [wysiwyg] option)
   were set.
   So this entry will open up again within the custom form generally per default to not
   lose or forget preset data.

   NOTE: YOU can still force this page running with an other selectable "Backend Template"
         by using the the forms top navigation bar, which sets a remembered backend_template
         COOKIE for all further page edits!
         Additionally, sending a staticpage form by SUBMIT generally sets the current used
         form template as the remembered COOKIE stored template name.
   EXAMPLE:
         So, once have sent a staticpage submit with eg. the 'custom_template' form, all
         further staticpage entry form requests will use this template, as long the COOKIE
         exists and is readable. BUT:
         If you generally use the Standard "responsive" template form for staticpages and
         just have some exceptional entries using the "custom" form, YOU now need to return
         setting the COOKIE for all further entries again, after having submitting an entry
         with the "custom" form, just by switching another entry (or the same) to another
         backend template via the selectable staticpage form top navigation bar.

         SOUNDS COMPLICATED, BUT ISN'T ! ;-)

         If you don't care, sticking to the "custom" template generally does not matter
         anything. It is just an extended "responsive" form (example).

6.50:
-----
 * Fix backend_template COOKIE readout to POST form array for the "default"
   ['custom_template.tpl', 'default_staticpage_backend.tpl', 'responsive_template.tpl']
   templates, with the "responsive" being the Standard and fallback template.

   NOTE: If using a custom (personal) backend template form file
         eg. like in the timeline theme [ 'timeline_staticpage_backend.tpl' ]
         please make sure to name it uniquely and different from the 3 standard ones!

6.49:
-----
 * Better check related category table action when deleting a staticpage by id

6.48:
-----

6.42:
-----
 * Preparation fixes for Styx 3.6+ and PHP 8.1 added AV1-Image-File (avif) support,
   which started to change some hooked key naming's to be more generic for media file variation rename actions.
   This has to migrate slowly to not break existing situations, so we start early enough pushing this out!

   the way arrays iterate their pointer.

5.18:
----

 * Allow unicode searches for Chinese / Japanese like languages, see:
        https://board.s9y.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=15112

    since just the very old hardcoded form)

    which is some sort of template too and some minor markups that get hooked)

 *  Changed for 2.0: default config value for show entrylist is now true

    - touches frontend templates (in this plugin dir) for HTML5, inline styles, Navigations, etc.
    - Needs you to update template copies in your template/theme!

    TL;DR - MAJOR CHANGES - PLEASE NOTE:
    Some of these commits will change behaviour or appearance for older staticpage entries.
    Please double check all your pages to show up correct, or at least check the major ones in difference.

    Also check for template staticpage files in need for an update. This may effect all kind of
    yourTheme/plugin_staticpage_***.tpl files and probably all backend-form-files in yourTheme/backend_templates/*.
    Theme templates in [2k11, Next, Bulletproof] delivered by core have already been changed when Staticpages DEV moves into Spartacus.

    Temporary disable (by directory name change) previous used theme based staticpage-backend-forms
    in /templates/yourTheme/backend_templates/*. Remove, if these were not specifically theme based, or contact your themes author.

    Check the Plugin configurations (event and sidebar)!

    Apart from UI changes, other small bugfixes, code review, refactoring and code cleanup, this mainly is:

    - A smart rework for 2.1+
    - Smartified the Backend
    - New backend-form-templates. [Check your theme! See note above.]
    - Precise staticpage database SELECT queries for the frontend, the sidebar and the backend
    - Backend listentries enhancements
    - Fixed navigation issues. Touches staticpage frontend related template files for markup navigation changes,
      regarding entry navigation, breadcrumb navigation and child navigation.
      [Check your theme to not work with old and unchanged copies!]
    - Associated strict 1:1 relation for staticpage related categories

Fix for not being able to edit a staticpage through the frontend's

3.70, 3.71:
-----------------------------

Major new functionalities:

    1. Allow to create custom smarty templates used for editing a
       staticpage.

       When editing a staticpage in the backend, you now have a dropdown
       where you can choose a template. The default file is placed
       in the plugin's subdirectory "backend_templates". You can
       add files there on your own, which are then shown in the
       dropdown as well.

       You can override the content of those files within your
       template directory, by placing a file named exactly the same way,
       in the "backend_templates" sub-directory of your template.
       Thus, you can put an empty file inside your plugin
       directory to initialize the ability to use a template-preference.

       The default template file has several smarty functions to query
       the current value and input fields. You can place all input
       fields the way you like, using Smarty/HTML layouts.

       You can also still switch to the "old way" through the dropdown.


    2. Introduce "custom properties" for staticpages.

        You need to add those custom properties to your custom smarty
        template, by accessing an input field "serendipity[plugin][custom][xxx]".
        The default backend template has a commented section for an
        example on how to use this.

        In your final smarty templates (either the staticpage_*.tpl files, or your
        usual smarty template files) you can access those custom properties through

        {$staticpage_custom.XXX}

        to place them anywhere you want.

To properly see the new layout, you might need to flush your browser's
CSS cache, as changes have been made to the plugin's CSS file.


3.61:
-----------------------------
Speed up call for getting staticpage list and cache it. Otherwise, the
plugin was unusable for thousands of staticpages, because the
walkrecursive() function is VERY expensive.
