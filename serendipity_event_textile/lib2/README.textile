PHP-Textile is a modern Textile markup language parser for PHP. Textile is a humane web text generator that takes lightweight, readable, plaintext-like markup language and converts it into well formed HTML.

This 2.5 branch holds a feature-frozen single-file version of PHP-Textile representing the v2.5.x releases. It is not PSR-0 compliant, but attempts to follow PSR-1 and PSR-2 in other respects. If you want the latest features use the master branch and 3.x releases, as this branch was feature frozen on 2013-11-06 and only receives security updates.

h2. Installing

h3. Using Composer

The recommended way to install PHP-Textile is via "Composer":https://getcomposer.org/ package manager. Navigate to your project directory, and run the command:

bc. $ composer require "netcarver/textile 2.5.*"

p. If you haven't yet used Composer, you will then want to include the autoloader file generated by Composer in your project:

bc. require './vendor/autoload.php';

h3. Manually

The only file that is necessary for the correct operation of PHP-Textile 2.x is @classTextile.php@ from the root directory. "Grab a copy of the latest Textile v2.5.x release":https://github.com/textile/php-textile/releases, extract the archive and include the @classTextile.php@ file in your application:

bc. require "classTextile.php";

h2. Usage

PHP-Textile parser can be accessed through the @Textile@ class. The class is highly configurable, and actual parsing happens with the @textileThis@ and @textileRestricted@ methods:

bc. $parser = new Textile();
echo $parser->textileThis('h1. Hello World!');

h3. Parsing untrusted input

If you are using PHP-Textile to format user-supplied input, blog comments for instance, use the @textileRestricted()@ method:

bc. $parser = new Textile();
echo $parser->textileRestricted('!bad/image/not/allowed.svg!');

This method doesn't allow the more powerful formatting options such as inline style, and removes any raw HTML.

h3. Doctypes

Currently, PHP-Textile can target either XHTML or HTML5 output with XHTML being the default for backward compatibility. The targeted doctype can be changed through the constructor:

bc. $parser = new Textile('html5');
echo $parser->textileThis('HTML(HyperText Markup Language)");

In HTML5 mode, you'll get @abbr@ instead of @acronym@ and if you use alignment markers on your images you'll have extra classes placed on them instead of XHTML's @align@ attribute.

h3. Setting alternate glyphs

Textile's typographic substitutions can be overridden with the @setSymbol@ method. If you need to setup Textile to do non-standard substitutions, call @setSymbol@ before you parse the input with @textileThis@ or @textileRestricted@.

bc. $parser = new Textile();
$parser->setSymbol('half', '1&#8260;2');
echo $parser->textileThis('Hello [1/2] World!');

The symbol names you can pass to @setSymbol()@ can be found "here":https://github.com/textile/php-textile/blob/582fb7e2af83bb043fe6dd3846220796c814f999/classTextile.php#L468.

h3. Prefixing relative image paths

Setting an image path prefix might be useful if your application only allows users to reference images from a certain location like, say, an images directory. The prefix can be set with the @setRelativeImagePrefix()@ method:

bc. $parser = new Textile('html5');
$parser->setRelativeImagePrefix('user/uploads');
echo $parser->textileThis('!image.png!');

h2. Running tests

Included unit tests can be run with PHPunit:

bc. $ composer install --dev
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit

Running tests requires PHP 5.3.3 and PCRE with PCRE_UTF8.
