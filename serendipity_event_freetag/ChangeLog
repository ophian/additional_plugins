   https://github.com/metaloha/jQuery.awesomeCloud.plugin for related Tag Clouds via
   the event plugin, and for sidebar and archive clouds via the sidebar plugin.
   PLEASE NOTE: Its usage prevents using the xml icon true option!


3.69: + 3.05 (sidebar):

 * The renderTags() method frontend tagcloud now uses a list styled markup, when not
   using flash.
 * Added a rotating tagcloud jQuery Canvas Plugin: jquery.tagcanvas.min.js v2.8,
   https://github.com/goat1000/TagCanvas for related Tag Clouds via
   the event plugin, and for sidebar and archive clouds via the sidebar plugin.
   This is a little limited in use, since it runs in more or less "squared" environment!
   PLEASE NOTE: Its usage prevents using the xml icon true option!


3.68: + 3.04 (sidebar):
-----------------------

 * Fix array_map 'htmlspecialchars' callback, to support PHP 5.4+ changes.

 * Re-organized the "tags to strtolower" option, to only apply to tags shown in all
   possible frontend situations at runtime. Also changed sidebar plugin to v.3.04 for this.
   Stored and backend tags are stored and shown as applied!
   The previous implementation had strange issues. This now is much more clear and straight!
   WHICH IS: Keep in backend as set or changed, run in frontend by option in both plugins,
             while covering different places of appearance!
 * New PHP version requirement >= 5.3.0


3.67:
-----

 * Fix example for taglist code, which needed a pagination fix.
 * Fix multitags delivered linklist array to not use the frontends
   entry pagination < 100 tags.
 * Added new sort option for multitags entries.

    please add a surrounding {if !$freetag_isList} to the cloud markup {/if}
    itself.

   list ", ", see http://board.s9y.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=20551 .

   as a multitag string, delimitered by ", ", like for head_subtitle.

   PLUGIN_EVENT_FREETAG_SUBTAG for langs <en> and <de>.

    This adds a 'taglist' tag as a reserved command to tags,
    which not allows this tag as a normal tag any further.
    The addition can be done either by the preset taglink as "/plugin/taglist/"
    or manually added by certain taglinks as "/plugin/tag/allyourtags/taglist".
    This needs you to modify your templates entries.tpl file,
    as described in the documentation file or the README.
