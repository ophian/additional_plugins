What is this?
-------------

PhoneBlogz is a system that allows you to leave a voice message by phone to be
posted to your Serendipity blog.  When a message is left, a page is requested 
on your Serendipity site that tells it to check phoneblogz.com for new messages.
If any new messages are found, they are posted to your blog.


Requirements
------------

The plugin currently requires at least Serendipity 1.0-beta1.
You'll need to register at http://www.phoneblogz.com to get an access code and 
PIN number


Setup steps
-----------

There are three things you'll need to setup for the system to work:

1) Register and configure an account at http://www.phoneblogz.com
   - go to http://www.phoneblogz.com and register for an account
   - make note of your access code and PIN number you receive via e-mail

2) Install the code and configure your Serendipity site
   - upload the serendipity_event_phoneblogz directory into your plugins
     directory
   - activate the plugin in the Plugins Configuration page
   - in Configure Plugins, go to the PhoneBlogz plugin and enter your
     access code and password (NOT PIN number!) and make any other changes.
   - in PhoneBlogz Users under the Admin menu, map each PhoneBlogz user
     to a Serendipity user

3) Using the system
   - call a PhoneBlogz access number (http://www.phoneblogz.com/help/howcanipost.php)
   - enter your access code and PIN number, then leave a message and press #
   - PhoneBlogz should then call your notify URL which should
     post the message to your blog.


Known problems
--------------

None at present!


Troubleshooting
---------------

If messages aren't appearing on your blog, check the following things:

1) On phoneblogz.com, make sure your message appears in the "Recent Blogz" page.
   If the message isn't there, contact us as something has gone wrong!

2) Go to the PhoneBlogz entries page.  You should see your message in a list.
   If it's not there check the access and PIN codes.

3) In a browser, go to the URL you entered in the Notification URL area.
   If the URL can't be found you're using the wrong notification URL.

4) If you're still having problems get in touch with us.
