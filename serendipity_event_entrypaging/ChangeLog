 * Fix a entrypaging prev/next paging issue to leave out group restricted entries and so only page-link on ALL (0) authorids entries.
   Only logged-in authors will see group restricted entry links, even when not being accessible for them by ACL when arriving at entry page.
   Logged-in Administrators or other group levels with granted parent rights are able to page through. But lower child levels will seen an empty page with no further entrypaging.
   Being more specific on ACL rights for them would make the entrypaging query gathering at this state way too complicated.
