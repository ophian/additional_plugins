2.1.0:
------
 * Improve entry saving for emptied custom links to return to the origin entries archives structure
 * Remove the given example link from the permalink input field to not accidentally save entries with the preconfigured permalink URL string.
   Instead have a button to put it in on demand.
   An empty field means: No permalink.
   No button and example URL for a custom permalink URL is given when the entry was already saved with an URL, which then is in the field already.
   Check your _entryproperties database table for WHERE property = 'permalink' to know all your already saved permalinks and nuke the ones you did not want to be a custom permalink.

   UPGRADERS:
    If you used this plugin before and did not always change the entryforms custom permalink input field value
    each time you saved a NEW entry, then you probably have some of these default URL values pointing to your entries.
    It did not do any other harm than to allow calling the first of these entries by "YourBlog/permalink/unknown.html".
    To avoid having such unnecessary entry property values, please clean up your database entryproperties table
    (replace "dbPrefix" by your prefix) simply by:
    ....
    DELETE FROM dbPrefix_entryproperties WHERE property = 'permalink' AND value LIKE '%/unknown.html'
    ....
