   UPGRADERS:
    If you used this plugin before and did not always change the entryforms custom permalink input field value
    each time you saved a NEW entry, then you probably have some of these default URL values pointing to your entries.
    It did not do any other harm than to allow calling the first of these entries by "YourBlog/permalink/unknown.html".
    To avoid having such unnecessary entry property values, please clean up your database entryproperties table
    (replace "dbPrefix" by your prefix) simply by:
    ....
    DELETE FROM dbPrefix_entryproperties WHERE property = 'permalink' AND value LIKE '%/unknown.html'
    ....
