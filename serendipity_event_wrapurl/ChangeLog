[Version 0.11 2016/07/21] by Ian

    - Plugin consistent changes
    - load LANG with lang API, extends required Serendipity version
    - Append CSS, not prepend
    - Change class name to lowercase


[Version 0.10.1 2014/11/25] by Onli

    - Use serendipity_specialchars fix

[Version 0.10 2014/04/08] by Garvin

    - Propagate $smarty.env.staticpage_pagetitle (and the others) so that it can be used in entries.tpl

[Version 0.9 2011/08/13] by Ian

    - changed css output to support newline breaks in serendipity.css (more a cosmetic change)

[Version 0.8 2010/12/02] by Ian

    - added     styleable id, to be individual to every single used wrapurl event, like "plugin_wrapurl_PAGETITLE" eg. #plugin_wrapurl_name1 { /* your css notation */ }
                This fixes the individual height setting, which did not work correctly in 0.7 taking always the last occurance of serendipity_event_wrapurl plugin
    - changed   surrounding table around iframe to a styleable div tag in plugin and your individual template css-file (optional)
    - changed   lang <en> file to support changes
