 * Portier is a self-hostable login service that you can use instead of passwords.
   Portier sits between your website and third-party services like Google Sign-In
   to provide your users the fastest and easiest login experience, without ever
   needing a new password.
   Portier is a successor of both discontinued BrowserID and Mozillas Persona.
   Therefore the serendipity_event_browserid plugin was renamed and reset for version.
