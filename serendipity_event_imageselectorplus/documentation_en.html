<h2 id="desc">General description</h2>
<p>
    ImageSelectorPlus plugin is used to facilitate manipulation with images, especially their insertion into posts.
</p>

<h2 id="quick">QuickBlog</h2>
<p>
    When uploading an image, you can post it directly. Follow the instructions above the QuickBlog form.
</p>

<h3>Modifying the design of QuickBlog post</h3>
<p>
    Plugin uses template file "plugin_quickblog.tpl" to display the inserted pictures. So by modifying it, you can change the design of displayed images.</p>
    <p>Information about pictures is stored in an array {$quickblog} which has several parts you can use in your template:
    <ul>
        <li>fullimage - path and filename to the big image</li>
        <li>image - path and filename to the thumbnail</li>
        <li>body - the body of the post</li>
        <li>exif_mode - type of exif information extraction ('internal', 'jhead', 'none'</li>
        <li>exif - field of exif information, please use the exif specifications to see the field values - use them like eq. "$quickblog.exif.COMMENT" or "$quickblog.exif.Focal_length"</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2 id="multi">Multiple image insertions (mediainsert galleries)</h2>
<p>
    Another functionality of this plugin is multiple image insertion. If you write an xml structure in your entry, this plugin then replaces this xml structure by pictures from your media library.
</p>

<h3>When is it useful?</h3>
<p>
    When you write a blog, where you want to include many pictures in your entries. When you have fifty images and these images numbered in an ascending row, it is lengthy to insert them one by one through the images selector. With this plugin, you can insert all of them using on a single line. 
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
    <h4>Example 1 - including parts of gallery</h4>
    <code><pre>
        &lt;mediainsert&gt;
            &lt;gallery name="MyHolidays/" /&gt;
            &lt;media type="single" name="pict0034" /&gt;
            &lt;media type="single" name="pict0032" /&gt;
            &lt;media type="range" prefix="pict00" start="35" stop="52" /&gt;
        &lt;/mediainsert&gt;
    </pre></code>
    <p>
        This example inserts from the directory "MyHolidays" picture "pict0034", then picture "pict0032" and then all pictures from "pict0035" to "pict0052".
        <ul>
        Plugin features:
        <li>It shows only picturse which are in the database. So if pictures 44,45,48 and 50 does not exist, the plugin will not fail. Simply it will not display the non-existing pictures.</li>
        <li>It respects order of pictures, so 34 will be displayed before 32.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Example 2 - including whole gallery at once</h4>
    <code><pre>
        &lt;mediainsert&gt;
            &lt;gallery name="MyHolidays/" /&gt;
            &lt;media type="gallery" /&gt;
        &lt;/mediainsert&gt;
    </pre></code>

    <h4>Example 3 - hides preview pictures after specified image number </h4>
    <code><pre>
        &lt;mediainsert&gt;
            &lt;gallery name="MyHolidays/" /&gt;
            &lt;media type="gallery" /&gt;
            &lt;media type="hideafter" nr="2" /&gt;
        &lt;/mediainsert&gt;
    </pre></code>
    <p>
        This example inserts all pictures from directory "MyHolidays", but disables visiblity from picture number 3.
        <ul>
        Why its useful?
        <li>If you are using a lightbox plugin, which inserts in all article images, there may be a lot of preview images.</li>
        <li>With hideafter you can stop the visibility of a huge list of preview pictures. But the lightbox is still working!</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Example 4 - Break floating by newline after certain number of images </h4>
    <code><pre>
        &lt;mediainsert&gt;
            &lt;gallery name="MyHolidays/" /&gt;
            &lt;media type="gallery" /&gt;
            &lt;media type="hideafter" nr="15" /&gt;
            &lt;media type="picperrow" pr="3" /&gt;
        &lt;/mediainsert&gt;
    </pre></code>
    <p>
        This example inserts all pictures from directory "MyHolidays", but disables visiblity from picture number 15.
        Moreover, an arrangement in 5 rows (15/3 = 5), so there are 3 images per row visible in 5 columns.
    </p>
      
<h3>Important</h3>
<p>The plugin is sensitive to bad xml syntax. So if it is not perfect, for example if you ommit ending backslash in the media tag, it can cause fail to your whole blog!</p>

<h3>Review of xml tags</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>&lt;mediainsert&gt;</dt>
    <dd>general container of media insertion</dd>

    <dt>&lt;gallery&gt;</dt>
    <dd>from which gallery to choose the images, attribute name gives the path (prom the directory uploads/ - without the first backslash and WITH the final backslash - "MyHolidays" or "/MyHolidays/" is false. Right is "MyHolidays/".)</dd>

    <dt>&lt;media&gt;</dt>
    <dd>Defines which media to insert, first attribute is "type" and it can have next values:
        <ul>
            <li>"single" - includes single image given by attribute "name"</li>
            <li>"gallery" - without other attributes, includes all images in gallery</li>
            <li>"range" - includes numbered images from "prefix""start" to "prefix""stop" (see example1)</li>
            <li>"hideafter" - hides preview pictures after "nr" ("lastvisiblenumber") (see example3)</li>
            <li>"picperrow" - Generate a break for an amount by image, thus the shown thumbnails are divided into rows (Example 4)</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Modifying the design of inserted galleries</h3>
<p>
    Plugin uses template file "plugin_mediainsert.tpl" to display the inserted pictures. So by modifying it, you can change the design of displayed images.</p>
    <p>Information about pictures is stored in an array {$plugin_mediainsert_media} which has these parts you can use in your template:
    <ul>
        <li>name - name of picture (filename without extension)</li>
        <li>extension - extension of filename</li>
        <li>realname - filename, the same as {$name}.{$extension}</li>
        <li>thumbnail_name - you can get the thumbnail name by {$name}.{$thumbnail_name}.{$extension}</li>
        <li>path - the same value as you provide in gallery tag</li>
        <li>comment1 - comment from database</li>
        <li>width - width of original image</li>
        <li>height - height of original image</li>
        <li>thumbwidth - width of thumbnail</li>
        <li>thumbheight - height of thumbnail</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2 id="unzip">Unzipping ZIP archives</h2>
<h3>What it is good for</h3>
<p>Typically when you want to upload many pictures at once. You need not to select every image distinctly. Just pack them in the ZIP archive, upload this archive and it will be unzipped on your blog.<br>
Since Serendipity 2.0 there is an inernal feature to upload multiple images at once and resize them automatically via jajascript/ajax. This has limitation to some of the featurea of this Plugin!</p>

<h3>Features of unzipping</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Files from archive are unzipped into the same directory, where the archive is uploaded.</li>
<li>Unzipped files (not necessarily images) will be inserted in the media database.</li>
<li>When selecting "Edit properties", unzipped images will be displayed.</li>
<li>Do not make zip files with subdirectories. I didn't tested it, but I am afraid it will not unzip the directories, it will put all files in the target directory.</li>
<li>Take into account the size of the archive. You have some limitations on maximal upload file size (typically 10MB).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 id="auto">Auto Resizing of Images</h2>

<p>This feature will automatically search through your blog post for images in the form:</p>

<pre>
&lt;img src="/uploads/myimage.jpg" width="100" height="150" /&gt;
</pre>

<p>When it finds an image tag in this form it will replace the value of 'src' attribute with the path 
to the image resizing script, serendipity_admin_image_selector.php. The end result would be something 
like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;img src="http://domain.com/serendipity_admin_image_selector.php?serendipity[image]=1&serendipity[disposition]=inline&serendipity[step]=showItem&serendipity[resizeWidth]=100&serendipity[resizeHeight]=150" width="100" height="150" /&gt;
</pre>

<p>This saves you time if you need to use images at multiple resolutions, and can also reduce 
download times for users. The performance hit is minimal as the image resize is only done once, 
as is the parsing of img tags.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Image aspect ratios are maintained.</li>
    <li>Only the width or height attribute needs to be specified. If neither is specified then the image tag is ignored</li>
    <li>If both the width and height attributes are specified the image will be scaled to fit within this area while maintaining the aspect ratio</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="dyn">Addition: Using "Allow dynamic image resizing"</h2>
<p>Actually there are several different available approaches for the auto image resizing.</p>
<ul>
    <li>1. Via hand-crafted GET parameters and the <em>serendipity_admin_imageselector.php</em> script
        <ul>
            <li>a. to just get a different image output to a src or image tab</li>
            <li>b. including the output file in a special crafted HTML page (via /templates/theme/media_showitem.tpl)</li>
            <li>c. with changes to the file and the storage</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>2. Using the quickblog resizing (including or without an entry)</li>
    <li>3. Not actually image resizing, but somehow similar, is the media insert gallery creation, see this documentation part <a href="#multi">"Multiple image insertions"</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <p>
        [<b>1</b>] This will access the serendipity_admin_imageselector.php script. It takes a <b>&serendipity[image]</b> GET parameter for the ID of the image you want to display.<br />
        Then you can use <b>&serendipity[resizeWidth]</b> and/or <b>&serendipity[resizeHeight]</b> to indicate the new size of that image.
    </p>
    <p>The following is about <b>output</b>, NOT storage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>&serendipity[show]</b> can be set to '<em>redirect</em>' if you want the script to redirect to the original image (without resizing) and '<em>redirectThumb</em>' to redirect to the original thumbnail (without resizing). Those methods will only count the referrers of an image without resizing.<br />
            If <b>&serendipity[show]</b> is set to '<em>full</em>' it will resize the original image, '<em>thumb</em>' resizes the thumbnail.</li>
        <li>Setting <b>&serendipity[show]</b> to anything else, be empty, or left away, will access the <em>media_showitem</em> page, see <b>1.b</b></li>
        <li><b>&serendipity[disposition]</b> can be set to '<em>attachment</em>' or '<em>inline</em>' to change the HTTP-Headers for the Mime Content-Disposition.</li>
        <li><b>&serendipity[step]</b> allows several (internal) actions to happen. '<em>showItem</em>' is the normal value for image show processing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <u>Example for 1a.</u>:
        <pre>serendipity_admin_image_selector.php?serendipity[image]=280&serendipity[show]=redirect&serendipity[disposition]=inline&serendipity[step]=showItem&serendipity[resizeWidth]=320&serendipity[resizeHeight]=240</pre>
    </p>
</ul>

<ul>
    <p>
        <u>1c.</u>:<br>
        If <b>NOT</b> using this <em>imageselectorplus</em> plugin, appending hand-crafted GET parameters for image resizing will create an independent image cache file directory "/templates_c/mediacache/" and the files are named "cache_img"+ID_WIDTH_HEIGHT, eg "cache_img1_300_300".<br>
        This is usefull for totally independent image management, eg. embedded systems etc., since the <em>serendipity_admin_imageselector</em> script has been developed to integrate the mediadatabase into another CMS, so this additional coding was not really tightly implemented for Serendipity as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Examples for 1c.</u>:
        <pre>serendipity_admin_image_selector.php?serendipity[image]=182&serendipity[step]=showItem&serendipity[show]=full&serendipity[resizeWidth]=300</pre>
        which is shown as the original image ('full' or 'thumb', depending on [show]), but stored as a "/templates_c/mediacache/cache_img182_300_" file for later usage, while
        <pre>serendipity_admin_image_selector.php?serendipity[image]=14&serendipity[step]=showItem</pre>
        displays the origin image as fullimage inside the embedded page (via templates/theme/media_showitems.tpl).
    </p>
    <p>The MediaLibrary and imageselectorplus history shows, that some of these steps in the <em>serendipity_admin_imageselector</em> script and even more went into the development of this plugin to extend the image media creation and accessment in various ways.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
    <p>
        [<b>2</b>] Uploaded, but <b>Quickblog</b> <u>resized</u> images are stored as a third (additional) media-file into the MediaLibrary, eg <em>"imagename.quickblog.jpg"</em>. Since this "independent" file shall not sync (file and database cleanup) or double your auto-thumbnail generation for the MediaLibrary, the Serendipity <b>Styx Edtion 2.4+</b> has been touched to exclude these "differing" quickblog thumbs to only inform you being present by an additional MediaLibrary action button.<br>
        These files always appear as "name.quickblog.extension". If the parent file and its thumb are purged, this quickblog "thumb" file is still present in "/uploads".
    </p>
