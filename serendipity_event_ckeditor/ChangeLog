    * Fix CKEditor WYSIWYG-mode styles regarding serendipity image comments and remove some redundant 2k11 styles.

      base64 encoded data, when inserting instagram image markup and switching mode. This class needs to be added manually to the inner div
      container, replacing the inline styles.
      A simplified Example:

<blockquote>
    <div style="padding:8px">
        <div style="background:#f8f8f8; line-height:0; margin-top:0; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%">
            <div class="instagram_preload">&nbsp;</div>
        </div>

        <p style="margin-left:8px; margin-right:8px">
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/xyz123Raw1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Really Nothing.</a>
        </p>

      force the script to redirect directly into the config on each
      CKEditor upgrade request.
      In case of using the Serendipity UPDATE ALL 1-click ajax-upgrader,
      this redirection is disabled and you have to force the extraction
      yourself in the config.
    * Disabled the temporary runtime solution to downgrade version for
      the harmonization of plugin and lib versions, which came in March

    * Introduce new config option to re-enable the CKE built-in image toolbar button.
      This is not recommended to do, but there may be people in need.
    MAJOR CHANGE:
      In Serendipity 2.0 development, we discovered CKEDITOR storing htmlentities
      to the database, which is ok normally, but does not work for search request results.
      We have now disabled config.entities and config.htmlEncodeOutput for the editor,
      to strictly let S9y handle this.
      The not catched search results did only happen to Umlauts or specialized chars!
      If you really are subjected to this for previous entries stored by this plugin editor,
      you will have to call and re-submit these entries again. Sorry!

    * The preset toolbars now hide the CKE image widget per css, but keep its internal
      functionality for the image placements via the S9y MediaLibrary button.
    * Touched some lang files.
    * Moved custom codesnippet css into highlight.css
    * Reset cached js configuration files on submit changes by timestamp

          need any CDN, and uses less resources being better integrated.
          But it uses a different highlighter js file (hightlight.pack.js).
    * Changed option prettify to be a compat mode only option for ugraders
      having used pbckcode code previously for entries.

        This update will remove the package completely from file tree.
        If that does not happen automatically, please purge the kcfinder directory by hand!
        This does not touch the previously used MediaLibrary KCfinder /uploads/images directory.
    * Update pbckcode plugin to v.1.2.3, which among others now fetches ACE via a CDN!
        See PBCKCODE (PRETTIFY) configuration in cke_config.js.
        Added a pre wrap modification to the prettify.css file:
          pre.prettyprint{ ...;white-space:pre;overflow:auto;}

2.3.5:
-----
    * Fixed config option to disable the codebutton plugin.
    * Due to some server compat constraints, marked by the KCFINDER homepage,
      a new config option was set, to enable KCFINDER integration by user only.
        NOTE: This changes the previous enabled KCFINDER integration to disabled!!
    * To better document KCFINDER and ACF some en/de lang file constants changed
    * Chrome Browser does not really work with KCFINDER on domains like "localhost"
      or other dotless local domain names. Please disable use for Chrome on local servers!

2.3.4:
-----
    * Some fixes to force zip install on demand method and some compat issues

2.3.3:
-----
    * Some tweaks to en, de lang files.
    * Fixed force_install to set new values to database config table.
    * Fixed Spartacus upgrade 'plugin_to_conf' again, by using 'external_plugin' hook,
      which now forces a real HTTP request and falls down to plugins instance config.
      The previous (2.3.2) 'install_plugin' did do, but created another plugin instance.
      If you were hit by this, please just purge other ckeditor instances in your plugin list.
      To push to "all" upgraders, the zip version num was bumped to force a deflate.

      [PLEASE NOTE: For Upgraders coming from 2.3.1 and earlier, the upgrade zip effect
       may possibly happen on next future upgrade only, thus force the zip upgrade by the
       new 'force_install' emergency option, if not happen automatically.]

2.3.2:
-----
    * Added config option to force zip install on demand,
      which is easier than purge/install routines on zip upgrade failures
    * Fix and prepare installer fallback on upgrades
    * Added HTML5 AUDIO tag protected source rule and be catched by
      procurator placeholder, to exclude from being touched by ACF

2.3.1:
-----
    * Fixed Chrome Browser Exception
    * Fixed installer fallback on upgrades

2.3.0:
-----
    * Check if zip extension loaded
    * Removed most of the inline code into 2 new files, which are:
         cke_config.js - the custom config.js file, which now substitutes every config option to CKE
         cke_plugin.js - the render and add button/plugin file, which loads the custom config file and now renders all backend textareas.
    * To take care about placed javascript, smarty tags and other protected source tags (like 'mediainsert' by imageselectorplus galleries),
         the new 'procurator' CKEDITOR Plugin (s9y-specific) was added, which acts like a hidden event plugin
         and takes care for the placeholder wysiwyg-mode replacements.
    * In order to be able to place prettified code snippets into entries, the
         'pbckcode' CKEDITOR Plugin was added (v 1.1.0, https://github.com/prbaron/PBCKCode).
         Including local prettify (js/css) by (current version, http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/)
