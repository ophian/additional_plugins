  * Update bundled shariff lib to 3.0.1
    This version uses local hosted webfonts. In order to save space
    and bandwidth, it supports .ttf, woff and .woff2 only. That means
    no support for legacy iOS (.svg) or IE < 9 (.eot).
    The CSS uses a hardcoded path "plugins/serendipity_event_social/fa/"
    to these fonts.
