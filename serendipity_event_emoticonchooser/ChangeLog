 * Improve 3.11 WYSIWYG-Editor emoticon plugin usage under different conditions,
   which there are:

    - simplified WYSIWYG (backend comments and special cases, like html nugget),
    - PLAIN TEXT Editor usage.
   Backend comments usage will do with upcoming Styx 2.6.
   Since HTML comments and a stored cache are involved too, this still might
   lack working straightaway ... just give me a note then.
