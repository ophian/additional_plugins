Additional plugins for Serendipity Weblog, Styx Edition.

The plugins contained here are automatically synced with Spartacus (plugin), the Serendipity **[S]**erendipity **[P]**lugin **[A]**ccess **[R]**epository **[T]**ool **[A]**nd **[C]**ustomization/**[U]**nification **[S]**ystem, if set this url **"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ophian/additional_plugins/master/"** into the **"Custom location for mirror"** Spartacus plugin option.
The XML sidebar or event plugin files in question are synced to contain new or updated submissions when required.

This will work with Styx only, which has some bugs fixed in core.

XML and RSS synchronizing make files (`*.sh` and `*.php`) are heftily tweaked to run with my local environment needs. Make your own (these files here are just the origin clones)!
