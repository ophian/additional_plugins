3.07 (sidebar):
-----------------------

 * Add configgroup separate helpers, re-sorting options to better apply
   into config groups.
 * Precised HTML Tag cloud option text for <en> <de> langs

3.70: + 3.06 (sidebar):
-----------------------

 * Added an awesome "wordle" like wordcloud Canvas plugin: jQuery.awesomeCloud v0.2,
   https://github.com/metaloha/jQuery.awesomeCloud.plugin for related Tag Clouds via
   the event plugin, and for sidebar and archive clouds via the sidebar plugin.
   PLEASE NOTE: Its usage prevents using the xml icon true option!


3.69: + 3.05 (sidebar):
-----------------------

 * Removed old category to tags subquery and other example from main html documentary
   and README file, since we have that as an administration task built in.
   (Left as copy in the very old README.txt file.)
 * Update jQuery to v.1.11.3 for Serendipity < 2.0
 * Tag-Administration buttons are now short-titled and provide the fully translated
   old content title as tooltip title.
 * Admin method displayLeafTaggedEntries() will now show this single (leaf) tag
 * The renderTags() method frontend tagcloud now uses a list styled markup, when not
   using flash.
 * Added a rotating tagcloud jQuery Canvas Plugin: jquery.tagcanvas.min.js v2.8,
   https://github.com/goat1000/TagCanvas for related Tag Clouds via
   the event plugin, and for sidebar and archive clouds via the sidebar plugin.
   This is a little limited in use, since it runs in more or less "squared" environment!
   PLEASE NOTE: Its usage prevents using the xml icon true option!


3.68: + 3.04 (sidebar):
-----------------------

 * Fix array_map 'htmlspecialchars' callback, to support PHP 5.4+ changes.
 * Internal cleanups: Fix or remove inconsistent and redundant code, Coding styles, etc.
 * Add configgroup separate helpers, re-sorting options to better apply
   into config groups.
 * Fixed possible Exception with wicktags.
 * Fixed tagListAnchor to not jump beneath input field, so you can actually
   see your tag click insert immediately.
 * Make this backend tagList entry input field "move" focussed to end,
   when using more tags than the input field length is able to show.
 * Fixed some backend freetag tasks!
 * Added more messages.
 * Fixed some constant lang messages ... <en> <de>.
 * Now uses a specialchars_mapper() method.
 * Re-allow the backends entry alphabet distinction in tag list.
 * Re-organized the "tags to strtolower" option, to only apply to tags shown in all
   possible frontend situations at runtime. Also changed sidebar plugin to v.3.04 for this.
   Stored and backend tags are stored and shown as applied!
   The previous implementation had strange issues. This now is much more clear and straight!
   WHICH IS: Keep in backend as set or changed, run in frontend by option in both plugins,
             while covering different places of appearance!
 * New PHP version requirement >= 5.3.0


3.67:
-----

 * Fix example for taglist code, which needed a pagination fix.
 * Fix multitags delivered linklist array to not use the frontends
   entry pagination < 100 tags.
 * Added new sort option for multitags entries.
 * Do not show related tags cloud, when using multitags.
   PLEASE NOTE:
    This changed the plugin_freetag.tpl file. If you have a template copy,
    please add a surrounding {if !$freetag_isList} to the cloud markup {/if}
    itself.
 * Changed multitag delimiter for the frontent from " + " to a comma separated
   list ", ", see http://board.s9y.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=20551 .
 * Fix constant PLUGIN_VARS_DISPLAYTAG for multitag arrays, to show up
   as a multitag string, delimitered by ", ", like for head_subtitle.
 * Added colon in constants for PLUGIN_EVENT_FREETAG_USING and
   PLUGIN_EVENT_FREETAG_SUBTAG for langs <en> and <de>.

    which not allows this tag as a normal tag any further.
    The addition can be done either by the preset taglink as "/plugin/taglist/"
    or manually added by certain taglinks as "/plugin/tag/allyourtags/taglist".
    This needs you to modify your templates entries.tpl file,
    as described in the documentation file or the README.
